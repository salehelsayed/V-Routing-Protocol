# V-Routing Protocol Documentation

## Overview
The V-Routing Protocol is a sophisticated peer-to-peer routing protocol designed for efficient and secure communication in distributed networks. It features dynamic cluster formation based on node centrality, multi-metric routing decisions, and adaptive network optimization.

## Key Features
- Dynamic cluster formation using eigenvector centrality
- Multi-phase node lifecycle management
- Adaptive heartbeat intervals with negative exponential decay
- Multi-metric routing decisions (latency, bandwidth, hop count, stability)
- Resource-aware cluster head election
- Secure inter-cluster communication
- Efficient message routing and forwarding
