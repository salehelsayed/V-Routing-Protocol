# V-Routing Protocol Implementation Tracker

## Changes Made

### Initial Setup
- Created this tracker file to document all changes

### Backend Changes Implemented
1. SimulationService.java:
   - Added `latestSimulationId` tracking
   - Updated simulation creation to use request parameters
   - Added proper cleanup of latestSimulationId on simulation stop
   - Added getter for latestSimulationId

2. SimulationEngine.java:
   - Added proper metrics tracking (messagesSent, messagesDelivered, totalLatency)
   - Implemented realistic message delivery simulation
   - Added proper metrics calculation methods
   - Added routing simulation with success probability
   - Added latency calculation based on simulated hops

3. SimulationController.java:
   - Added new `/api/simulation/status` endpoint for latest simulation
   - Added new `/api/simulation/metrics` endpoint for latest simulation
   - Added proper error handling for no active simulation

### Frontend Changes Implemented
1. index.html:
   - Added simulation state management with `simulationActive` flag
   - Improved error handling for all API calls
   - Added UI reset functionality between simulations
   - Enhanced status display with total steps
   - Added proper response validation
   - Improved metrics display with null checks
   - Added better error state handling
   - Enhanced user feedback during simulation

### Improvements Made
1. Metrics Collection:
   - Now properly tracks message delivery rate
   - Calculates average latency based on successful deliveries
   - Tracks total messages sent and delivered

2. Simulation State:
   - Better handling of simulation lifecycle
   - Proper tracking of current simulation state
   - Improved error handling for missing simulations

3. User Experience:
   - Clearer status indicators
   - Real-time progress updates
   - Better error feedback
   - Smoother transitions between simulation states

### Testing Completed
