## Story 1.1: Implement and Customize Peer Discovery Mechanisms

### Tasks

- **Task 1.1.1:** Implement mDNS for local peer discovery.
- **Task 1.1.2:** Configure DHT for global peer discovery.

---

### Task 1.1.1: Implement mDNS for Local Peer Discovery

**Instructions:**

1. **Understand mDNS (Multicast DNS):**

   - mDNS allows devices on the same local network to discover each other without a central server.
   - It's suitable for peers connected to the same Wi-Fi network.

2. **Add mDNS Dependency:**

   - Ensure that `jvm-libp2p` includes support for mDNS.
   - If additional dependencies are required, add them to your `build.gradle` file.

3. **Implement mDNS in the Libp2p Node:**

   - Initialize mDNS in your node configuration.

   ```kotlin
   import io.libp2p.core.Host
   import io.libp2p.core.PeerId
   import io.libp2p.discovery.mdns.MDnsDiscovery

   val mdnsDiscovery = MDnsDiscovery(node)
   mdnsDiscovery.start()

   mdnsDiscovery.addDiscoveryListener { peerId: PeerId, multiaddrs ->
       // Handle discovered peers
       println("Discovered peer: $peerId")
   }
   ```

4. **Handle Discovered Peers:**

   - When a peer is discovered, add it to your list of known peers.
   - Optionally, establish a connection or initiate communication.

**Definition of Done:**

- mDNS is implemented and integrated into the Libp2p node.
- The app can discover other peers on the same local network.
- Discovered peers are handled appropriately within the app.

**Expected Tests:**

- **Test 1:** Run the app on two devices connected to the same network and verify that they discover each other.
- **Test 2:** Validate that discovered peers are correctly added to the peer list.
- **Test 3:** Ensure no errors occur during the discovery process.

### Task 1.1.2: Configure DHT for Global Peer Discovery

**Instructions:**

1. **Understand DHT (Distributed Hash Table):**

   - DHT allows for peer discovery across different networks.
   - Useful when peers are not on the same local network.

2. **Add DHT Support:**

   - Include the DHT module from `jvm-libp2p`.

   ```kotlin
   import io.libp2p.protocol.DHT

   val dht = DHT(node)
   ```

3. **Configure DHT in the Libp2p Node:**

   - Add DHT protocols to the node's protocol handler.

   ```kotlin
   node.getProtocols().add(dht)
   ```

4. **Bootstrap Nodes:**

   - Set up bootstrap nodes to help with initial peer discovery.
   - Use known peers or public bootstrap nodes.

   ```kotlin
   val bootstrapPeers = listOf(
       Multiaddr("/ip4/1.2.3.4/tcp/4001/p2p/QmPeerId1"),
       Multiaddr("/ip4/5.6.7.8/tcp/4001/p2p/QmPeerId2")
   )
   ```

5. **Start DHT Discovery:**

   - Initiate the DHT discovery process.

   ```kotlin
   dht.start()
   ```

6. **Handle Discovered Peers:**

   - Similar to mDNS, handle peers discovered via DHT.

**Definition of Done:**

- DHT is configured and integrated into the Libp2p node.
- The app can discover peers globally, beyond the local network.
- Bootstrap nodes are set up and functional.

**Expected Tests:**

- **Test 1:** Simulate peers on different networks and verify discovery.
- **Test 2:** Confirm that the app can connect to bootstrap nodes.
- **Test 3:** Check that the discovery process continues to find new peers over time.

## Story 1.2: Extend and Test Messaging Protocols

### Tasks

- **Task 1.2.1:** Design and implement custom messaging protocols.

---

### Task 1.2.1: Design and Implement Custom Messaging Protocols

**Instructions:**

1. **Define Protocol Identifiers:**

   - Choose a unique protocol ID for your messaging protocol.

   ```kotlin
   val CHAT_PROTOCOL_ID = "/myapp/chat/1.0.0"
   ```

2. **Design Message Formats:**

   - Decide on the message structure (e.g., JSON, Protobuf).
   - Define fields like sender ID, message content, timestamp.

   ```json
   {
     "senderId": "QmSenderPeerId",
     "content": "Hello, World!",
     "timestamp": 1625247600
   }
   ```

3. **Implement Protocol Handler:**

   - Create a class that implements `ProtocolHandler`.

   ```kotlin
   import io.libp2p.core.Stream
   import io.libp2p.core.multistream.ProtocolId
   import io.libp2p.core.multistream.ProtocolHandler

   class ChatProtocolHandler : ProtocolHandler<ChatController> {
       override val protocolId = ProtocolId.of(CHAT_PROTOCOL_ID)

       override fun onStartInitiator(stream: Stream): CompletableFuture<ChatController> {
           val controller = ChatController(stream)
           // Initialize as initiator
           return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(controller)
       }

       override fun onStartResponder(stream: Stream): CompletableFuture<ChatController> {
           val controller = ChatController(stream)
           // Initialize as responder
           return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(controller)
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Create Controller for Message Handling:**

   ```kotlin
   class ChatController(val stream: Stream) {
       private val reader = BufferedReader(InputStreamReader(stream.inputStream))
       private val writer = BufferedWriter(OutputStreamWriter(stream.outputStream))

       fun sendMessage(message: ChatMessage) {
           val jsonMessage = Gson().toJson(message)
           writer.write(jsonMessage)
           writer.newLine()
           writer.flush()
       }

       fun receiveMessages(callback: (ChatMessage) -> Unit) {
           CompletableFuture.runAsync {
               var line: String?
               while (reader.readLine().also { line = it } != null) {
                   val message = Gson().fromJson(line, ChatMessage::class.java)
                   callback(message)
               }
           }
       }
   }

   data class ChatMessage(
       val senderId: String,
       val content: String,
       val timestamp: Long
   )
   ```

5. **Register the Protocol Handler with the Node:**

   ```kotlin
   node.protocolHandlers.add(ChatProtocolHandler())
   ```

6. **Initiate Communication:**

   - When you want to send a message, open a stream to the peer.

   ```kotlin
   val chatControllerFuture = node.newStream(peerId, listOf(CHAT_PROTOCOL_ID))
   chatControllerFuture.thenAccept { chatController ->
       val message = ChatMessage(
           senderId = node.peerId.toBase58(),
           content = "Hello!",
           timestamp = System.currentTimeMillis()
       )
       chatController.sendMessage(message)
   }
   ```

7. **Handle Incoming Messages:**

   - On receiving a stream, the `onStartResponder` method is called.

   ```kotlin
   chatController.receiveMessages { message ->
       println("Received message from ${message.senderId}: ${message.content}")
   }
   ```

**Definition of Done:**

- Custom messaging protocol is designed and implemented.
- Protocol handlers for initiators and responders are functional.
- Messages can be sent and received between peers.

**Expected Tests:**

- **Test 1:** Send a message from one peer to another and verify receipt.
- **Test 2:** Validate message integrity and correctness of the data format.
- **Test 3:** Ensure that unsupported peers do not cause application crashes.
