## Epic 1: Core Peer-to-Peer Networking

*(Remains largely the same as previously defined, ensuring comparable size with other epics.)*

### Objective

Implement and customize the networking stack for robust peer-to-peer communication using `libp2p`.

### User Stories

- **Story 1.1:** Implement and customize peer discovery mechanisms.
- **Story 1.2:** Extend and test messaging protocols.
- **Story 1.3:** Implement secure communication channels.
- **Story 1.4:** Optimize networking for mobile devices.

### Tasks

- **Task 1.1.1:** Implement mDNS for local peer discovery.
- **Task 1.1.2:** Configure DHT for global peer discovery.
- **Task 1.2.1:** Design and implement custom messaging protocols.
- **Task 1.3.1:** Integrate Noise/TLS encryption protocols.
- **Task 1.4.1:** Optimize network settings for battery efficiency.

*(Details of tasks include code snippets, instructions, DoD, and expected tests as previously defined.)*
