## Epic 0: Project Initialization and Setup

### Objective

Establish the project's foundation by setting up the development environment, defining the file structure, collecting necessary code snippets, and preparing the repository for collaborative work.

### User Stories

- **Story 0.1:** As a developer, I want to set up the project structure to ensure a solid foundation for development.
- **Story 0.2:** As a developer, I need to collect and organize code snippets relevant to the project's functionality.
- **Story 0.3:** As a team, we need a configured repository with version control to collaborate efficiently.

### Tasks

#### Story 0.1: Set Up Project Structure

**Task 0.1.1: Define Project File Structure**

- **Instructions:**
  - Create a standard Android project structure.
  - Organize packages for activities, fragments, services, models, utilities, and networking.
  - Example structure:
    ```
    com.example.app
    ├── activities
    ├── fragments
    ├── services
    ├── models
    ├── utils
    └── networking
    ```
- **Definition of Done:**
  - The project file structure is created and follows best practices.
  - Directories and packages are set up for future code placement.
- **Expected Tests:**
  - Verify that the project builds successfully with the new structure.
  - Ensure no classpath or package conflicts exist.

**Task 0.1.2: Configure Build Scripts and Dependencies**

- **Instructions:**
  - Update `build.gradle` files to include necessary plugins and dependencies.
  - Add dependencies for `libp2p`, `Room`, and other libraries.
  - Example `build.gradle` snippet:
    ```groovy
    dependencies {
        implementation 'io.libp2p:jvm-libp2p:0.x.x' // Use actual version
        implementation 'androidx.room:room-runtime:2.x.x'
        kapt 'androidx.room:room-compiler:2.x.x'
        // Other dependencies...
    }
    ```
- **Definition of Done:**
  - Build scripts are configured with all required dependencies.
  - The project syncs without errors.
- **Expected Tests:**
  - Perform a Gradle sync to ensure all dependencies are resolved.
  - Build the project to confirm there are no compilation issues.

#### Story 0.2: Collect and Organize Code Snippets

**Task 0.2.1: Gather Relevant Code Snippets**

- **Instructions:**
  - Collect code snippets for `libp2p` integration, peer discovery, messaging protocols, and data handling.
  - Store snippets in a designated directory or documentation file.
- **Definition of Done:**
  - All relevant code snippets are collected and organized.
  - Snippets are accessible to all team members.
- **Expected Tests:**
  - Review snippets for completeness and relevance.
  - Ensure code snippets are syntactically correct.

**Task 0.2.2: Document Snippet Usage**

- **Instructions:**
  - Create a reference document explaining how each snippet will be used.
  - Include examples and context for implementation.
- **Definition of Done:**
  - Documentation for code snippets is complete and clear.
- **Expected Tests:**
  - Validate that team members understand how to use the snippets.
  - Confirm that the documentation aligns with project requirements.

#### Story 0.3: Initialize Repository and Version Control

**Task 0.3.1: Create and Configure Repository**

- **Instructions:**
  - Set up a repository on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
  - Initialize with a `.gitignore` file tailored for Android projects.
- **Definition of Done:**
  - Repository is created and configured.
  - Repository settings (branch protection, access control) are established.
- **Expected Tests:**
  - Team members can clone and push to the repository.
  - Verify that unnecessary files (e.g., build artifacts) are ignored.

**Task 0.3.2: Establish Version Control Practices**

- **Instructions:**
  - Define a branching strategy (e.g., Gitflow).
  - Document commit message conventions and code review processes.
- **Definition of Done:**
  - Version control practices are documented and agreed upon.
- **Expected Tests:**
  - Review sample commits for adherence to conventions.
  - Ensure that branch protections enforce the defined practices.
