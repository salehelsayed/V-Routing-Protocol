Before discussing the appropriate architecture for your Java project applying this protocol on top of sockets, I would need clarification on a few critical areas:

Protocol Integration Details:

How do you plan to integrate the Wi-Fi-based P2P ad-hoc protocol with your Java application? Are there specific libraries or Android APIs that you intend to use?
Will the project include a multi-hop messaging layer, and how will it handle message relays between cluster heads?
Cluster Management:

What strategy will you use for cluster formation and cluster head election? Will you implement "Eigen vector centrality" directly in Java, or do you have a different approach in mind?
What mechanism will you use to manage connections between multiple clusters (e.g., encrypted tunnels)?
Scalability Requirements:

What is the expected maximum number of devices per subnetwork?
How will your architecture handle dynamic changes in cluster membership?
Routing and Security:

How do you plan to implement routing logic between clusters? Will you use static routing, dynamic routing, or a hybrid approach?
What encryption methods will you use for tunnel management and secure communication?
Connectivity Scenarios:

How will your application differentiate between internet-connected and offline modes? What fallback mechanisms are planned for offline operations?
Testing and Maintenance:

What kind of testing environment do you envision for simulating multi-hop messaging and cluster communication?
How do you plan to monitor and maintain the system's performance and security?
Answering these questions will ensure the architectural discussion is well-aligned with your project's requirements and challenges.

1.1: that is what we want to develop. 
1.2: this is the main aim of the project
2.1: Java for now, but make it as an interface to be implemented in anyother way
2.2: pre-existing security keyes shared between users that exist in different clusters.

6.1: Testing different scenarios of :
- routing fallback algorithm as defined in the document
- switching in routing priorities
- simulating multiple instances of the nodes and collect them as a network and report network connectivity KPIs as if we are simulating an agent based model

  * **Implement Multi-hop Layer with the Following Steps:**
    1. **Heartbeat Signal:**
       * Broadcasted on the ad-hoc network to monitor node status.

       * **Heartbeat 1:** "I'm here."
         * **Response:** Acknowledgment ("We are aware of your presence. At least one connection will be made.")
       * **Heartbeat 2:** Stability Confirmation
         * Neighboring nodes recognize stability and begin forwarding to second-degree nodes.
       * **Heartbeat 3:** Network Expansion
         * Continues growing until the 4th layer, then transitions to Phase 3.
    3. **Phase 3:**
       * **Cluster Head Election:**
         * Nodes assess their position using "Eigen vector centrality."
         * Top N nodes (based on centrality index) within the subnetwork become cluster heads.
         * **N Calculation:** Based on the subnetwork size (e.g., 2^max_degree where max_degree is 4, allowing up to 1024 users per subnetwork).
       * **Cluster Head Responsibilities:**
         1. **Network Governance:**
            * Acts as a router for up to 1,000 users in the subnetwork.

#### **f. Cluster Head (CH) Role and Responsibilities**

* **Vision on the Entire Network:**
  * Oversees the network's structure and connectivity.
* **Calculation of N (Number of Cluster Heads):**

    * **A2:**  User wants to send a request to B2


  * **Cluster B:**
    * **CHB:** Cluster Head 
    * **B1:** User has an encrypted connection with A1 in Cluster A.
    * **B2:** User expects a message request
* **Connection Request:**
  1. **A2** in **Cluster A** send an unencrypted request to connect to **B2** in **Cluster B**.
  2. **B2** asks **CHB** for any requests to **Cluster A**
  3. **CHB** checks **Cluster B** for existing encrypted connections to **Cluster A**.
  4. **CHB** finds **B1** and asks for a secure connection to **CHA**
  5. CHB informs CHA A2:B2 request and the available tunnel

Plugin Architecture: Design the package to support plugins or modules, allowing easy addition of new features.
Protocol Extensions: Facilitate the integration of new protocols or routing algorithms as needed.
Customizable Components: Allow developers to customize or replace core components without affecting the entire system.
20. Deployment and Distribution
Package Distribution: Determine the best methods for distributing the Java package (e.g., Maven repositories, direct downloads).
Dependency Management: Manage dependencies effectively to prevent conflicts and ensure smooth installations.
Containerization: Consider containerizing the package for consistent deployment across different environments.
Addressing these perspectives will help ensure that your Java package is robust, scalable, secure, and user-friendly, ultimately leading to a successful implementation of multi-hop ad-hoc networking on top of Wi-Fi Direct.

If you need further elaboration on any of these areas or assistance in integrating them into your development plan, feel free to ask!

Okay, so I'm going through your notes 1 / 1. For the API designing music due to interfaces, easy blood extension, design, AP. I to allow enhancements without breaking back. This is not what I meant. Resource management, this is not what I meant. I think you misunderstood my objective. So what we need right now is to do find the architectures, the classes And the functions and the calls between the functions 2 have a package that serves the the the defined scope. When described above, but at the same time, let's doing it from an ad hog perspective doing it, how it will define how the node itself will behave to work. I want to have such overall. A performance of an ad hoc network so I will give you a bit of more introduction so you get more to the topic and and what we want to do so right now. This code base will be part of a bigger project that will enable ad hoc networking on top of Wi-Fi direct. This is um, an open source thingy. It has nothing to do with localization. Updates, compliance is legals. This is not our focus at all. We are just focusing on the technical part only, and we are focusing also on how to write the cleanest code possible and how to write the code, and in a manner that is are able to to be extended for further use cases as referencing the things so You can have also a bit of a feeling of what I have in mind. I believe that we will have a note that is starting to form a vision about how people, how much, how many people around it, or how how do you know how through the multipears they this don't have through the Wi-Fi direct? How can it access? People around, uh, that note so it will start with a heartbeat so it will broadcast message that tells about its existence and it will turn the message with the people answering the message that they are valid route the depth of the message into the network to scare its depth depends on how long this note existed. In the network, and this will be the heartbeat and also the the interf add hoc network's communication, so the communication between network's encryption channels is also of the incorporated in the meeting minutes that we supplied to you earlier and I wonder how you would suggest an architecture in Java. With the expected behavior of each class and data structure and also list the missing information that we have so we can optimize this code further. If you know it's possible, try to put the question marks within under the appropriate method.Names rather than just listing them on the site

Thought for 31 seconds
Understood. To effectively define a Java architecture for your ad-hoc networking package on top of Wi-Fi Direct, focusing on multi-hop capabilities from a node-centric perspective, we'll outline a detailed class structure. This will include classes, their responsibilities, key methods, data structures, and interactions. Additionally, I'll highlight areas where further information is needed to complete the architecture.

3. Interactions Between Classes
Node Initialization:

Node initializes its ConnectionManager, HeartbeatManager, ClusterManager, RoutingManager, and EncryptionManager.
Node starts the heartbeat process and begins cluster discovery.
Heartbeat Mechanism:

HeartbeatManager periodically sends HeartbeatMessage to connected nodes via ConnectionManager.
Upon receiving a heartbeat, HeartbeatManager updates node status and adjusts heartbeat frequency if needed.
Cluster Management:

ClusterManager discovers nearby nodes and forms clusters.
ClusterManager handles cluster head elections using eigenvector centrality.
ClusterHead manages intra-cluster routing and maintains encrypted tunnels.
Routing and Multi-hop Messaging:

RoutingManager handles route discovery and maintenance using DSR.
MultiHopManager manages forwarding messages across multiple hops based on routing tables.
Message objects are routed from source to destination, incrementing hop counts at each step.
Secure Communication:

EncryptionManager encrypts outgoing messages and decrypts incoming messages.
KeyManager manages encryption keys, including generation and rotation.
Connection Management:

ConnectionManager manages active connections, monitors their health, and handles data transmission.
SocketHandler deals with low-level socket operations for establishing and maintaining connections.

You said:
I really like your response. However, I see some perspectives missing first of all, can you add to that U ML? Also class, that defines a message. What's the payload and message types? To define what type of message is that is it a broadcasting message, or is it for you example? A message that is running back from somewhere as an answer for a tcp call. Also the the root of this message, it's history, where did he go through to come to me and persist that somewhere that you know these messages and routing history and so forth, especially before analysis, also, since we're having different roles for different nodes that is defined bye. How Central they are and the hot beads and the levels. Yes, and so forth, so we will use the route in history to create their vision about the network, and from this vision, they will. The node will calculate its centrality, and we'll decide if it's going to be a group owner or not, and if it's a group owner, it broadcasts. The message for everyone to be, I were aware that it is now a group owner and starting to act so so this means that we will have different nodes. So this means notes should be a superclass with different different implementation, and this might be even extended to none connection related, uh, roles like coasting, and stuff, so I would be I'm highly stressed on that I really like. What you you presented, but can we go a bit deeper turn into the functionalities of each of these classes without writing the goal, just define them wealth and define their interactions with the other functions and other methods of other quotes of other classes and so forth and other methods? Please also try to make the the structure. The the the structure well defined in terms of explainability, so it covers the the class of different perspectives, either code related or functional
ChatGPT

Thought for a couple of seconds
I'm glad you found the initial response helpful! Let's delve deeper into the architecture, incorporating the additional perspectives you've highlighted. We'll outline a comprehensive class structure, define message types and payloads, incorporate node roles with a superclass and subclasses, and describe the interactions between classes in detail. Additionally, I'll provide a text-based UML diagram to visualize the architecture.

Implementation: Define how messages are serialized (toBytes()) and deserialized (fromBytes(byte[] data)), ensuring consistency across all nodes.
6.3. Routing Table Management
Update Frequency:
Criteria: Determine how often routing tables are updated and what events (e.g., node join/leave, connection failure) trigger updates.
Route Selection Criteria:
Metrics: Define the metrics used to select optimal routes, such as lowest latency, highest bandwidth, or minimal hop count.
6.4. Secure Tunnel Management
Tunnel Establishment:
Steps: Outline the process for establishing secure tunnels between cluster heads, including handshake protocols and key exchanges.
Tunnel Maintenance:
Integrity Checks: Implement periodic integrity checks to ensure tunnels remain secure and functional.
Re-establishment: Define procedures for re-establishing tunnels in case of disruptions.

7. Enhanced Class Functionalities and Interactions
7.1. Enhanced Message Class
To accommodate different message types and routing history, the Message class needs to be robust and flexible.

Fields:

public class Message {
    private String sourceNodeId;
    private String destinationNodeId;
    private byte[] payload;
    private int hopCount;
    private MessageType type;
    private List<String> routingHistory; // Tracks node IDs traversed
    private long timestamp;
    
    // Additional fields as needed
}
Methods:

incrementHopCount(): Increments the hop count each time the message is forwarded.
addToRoutingHistory(String nodeId): Logs the node ID to the routing history.
toBytes(): Serializes the message into a byte array for transmission.
fromBytes(byte[] data): Deserializes a byte array back into a Message object.
Interactions:

ClusterHeadNode periodically calculates its centrality based on the routingHistory and network vision.
Role Transition:
If a node's centrality exceeds a predefined threshold, it transitions to ClusterHeadNode.
Broadcast Announcement:
Upon becoming a ClusterHeadNode, the node broadcasts an announcement message to inform other nodes of its new role.
Dynamic Role Management:

Superclasses and Subclasses:
The Node superclass allows for easy extension into different roles (e.g., RegularNode, ClusterHeadNode).
Extensibility:
Future roles (e.g., CoordinatorNode) can be added by extending the Node class without affecting existing functionalities.
7.3. Routing History and Network Vision
Routing History:

Purpose: Maintains a record of all nodes a message has traversed, aiding in centrality calculations and preventing routing loops.

Storage:

Each Message instance carries its own routingHistory, which nodes update upon forwarding the message.
Network Vision:

Purpose: Allows nodes, especially ClusterHeadNodes, to form a comprehensive view of the network's topology and node centrality.

Implementation:

Aggregates routing histories from various messages to assess the network's structure and identify central nodes.
Centrality-Based Actions:

Centrality Assessment:
Nodes use accumulated routing data to calculate their eigenvector centrality.
Role Assignment:
Based on centrality scores, nodes decide whether to assume the role of ClusterHeadNode.
Vision Updating:
ClusterHeadNodes continuously update their network vision based on incoming routing histories and message flows.

I think there is a small misunderstanding that might be the. Reason for not finding. Uh, what I'm looking for so the misunderstanding is about the problem of encryption, so there are 2 ways of encryption secure information about secure tunnels coming from outside that we that these tunnels are done through internet normally, and this information is supplied. To the system as Jason file, uh, or as well. An object However, the most important part would be that the cycle we had supplied in the first message. The one with cluster a and cluster B example. The one with the cluster had B stocking to be 1B1 having a secure connection to a 1 and so forth. This example is referring to the secure connections from outside the world, and how it can be orchestrated to empower security for users without the security connection and handshake. The centrality part that you were asking about. In section 6.1, the centrality part, so we will create a matrix like Like the adjacency matrix of the graph theory through the messaging history and the heartbeat signals, we will create a vision for the note about its surroundings. In a later phase, we will incorporate the connectivity of nodes into that decision. But for now, the eigenvector centrality will be calculated on the adjacency matrix. Of that network that is collected from the heartbeats, and from droughting messages. I think there will be a directory of peers must be there with the last time. We saw that person and how was the connection and the lost accessible routing, and the last accessible location information. Such history is important for our adjacency. Matrix Forming algorithm, this means that any um load can be Central enough at some point of time to take the role of cluster head. This is an option, a flag that comes also from above that it fit is allowed to be a cluster head or not, and as soon it is acting as a clusterhead, all its cluster head activities. Shall be logged and communicated to all other clusterheads. Within this cluster, please also include a message type enumerator with all the possible message types, and please suggest all the message types you see necessary like the heartbeat signals, what they mean. The depth of the heartbeat signals also you make May outline how the node would react with when it receives different types, and when it sends different types

    // Add other types as needed
}
3. Interactions Between Classes
3.1. Node Initialization and Shutdown
Initialization:

Node initializes its managers: ConnectionManager, HeartbeatManager, ClusterManager, RoutingManager, and EncryptionManager.
Node starts the heartbeat process via HeartbeatManager.
ClusterManager begins cluster discovery.
RoutingManager initializes routing protocols (e.g., DSR).
Shutdown:

Node stops the heartbeat process.
ConnectionManager closes all active connections.
ClusterManager handles node removal from clusters.
EncryptionManager closes secure tunnels.
3.2. Heartbeat Mechanism
Sending Heartbeats:

HeartbeatManager periodically sends HEARTBEAT messages to all connected nodes.
Heartbeats include node ID, timestamp, and node state.
Receiving Heartbeats:

HeartbeatManager processes incoming HEARTBEAT messages.
Updates PeerDirectory with the sender's status and last seen timestamp.
Adjusts heartbeat frequency based on network stability.
3.3. Cluster Formation and Cluster Head Election
Cluster Discovery:

ClusterManager sends discovery messages and waits for responses.
Nodes respond with their status and willingness to join a cluster.
Cluster Formation:

ClusterManager forms new clusters with nodes that are eligible cluster heads.
If no cluster head is present, eligible nodes elect themselves based on centrality scores.
Cluster Head Election:

ClusterManager triggers cluster head election events (e.g., node failure, periodic reevaluation).
ClusterHeadNode calculates its eigenvector centrality using the adjacency matrix derived from PeerDirectory.
If eligible, ClusterHeadNode broadcasts its role using CLUSTER_HEAD_ANNOUNCEMENT messages.
Other nodes recognize the new cluster head and update their cluster memberships.
3.4. Routing and Multi-Hop Messaging
Sending Messages:

Node creates a Message object with appropriate MessageType.
RoutingManager determines the optimal route using the RoutingTable.
Message is forwarded hop by hop until it reaches the destination.
Receiving Messages:

Node receives a Message via Connection.
Message is decrypted using EncryptionManager.
RoutingManager processes the message based on its type:
UNICAST/BROADCAST: Deliver to the target node or forward.
ROUTE_REQUEST/ROUTE_REPLY: Handle route discovery and update routing tables.
CLUSTER_HEAD_ANNOUNCEMENT: Update peer cluster heads.
Multi-Hop Handling:

MultiHopManager ensures messages do not exceed the maximum hop count.
RoutingManager updates routes based on dynamic network conditions.
3.5. Secure Tunnel Management
Establishing Tunnels:

ClusterHeadNode establishes secure tunnels with peer cluster heads.
Secure tunnel information is supplied via configuration (JSON or object).
Maintaining Tunnels:

EncryptionManager manages encryption for secure tunnels.
ClusterHeadNode monitors tunnel integrity and re-establishes tunnels as needed.

7. Missing Perspectives and Further Considerations
While the architecture is now more comprehensive, several aspects still require further clarification and definition to ensure a robust implementation:

7.1. Cluster Head Election Details
Eigenvector Centrality Calculation:

Library vs. Custom Implementation: Decide whether to use an existing library like JGraphT for graph-based centrality calculations or implement your own eigenvector centrality algorithm.
Data Inputs: Ensure that the PeerDirectory accurately reflects current network topology to provide correct data for centrality calculations.
Election Triggers:

Events: Define specific events that trigger a cluster head election, such as:
A node leaving or joining the network.
Periodic reevaluation of centrality scores.
Detection of a failed cluster head.
Procedure: Outline the steps for conducting an election, including how nodes communicate their centrality scores and agree on the new cluster head.
7.2. Message Serialization and Deserialization
Serialization Format:

Choice: Decide between using JSON for readability and ease of debugging or binary formats like Protocol Buffers for efficiency.
Consistency: Ensure that all nodes adhere to the same serialization format to prevent incompatibilities.
Implementation:

Robustness: Handle serialization/deserialization errors gracefully to maintain network stability.
Security: Ensure that serialized data is sanitized and validated to prevent injection attacks.
7.3. Routing Table Management
Update Frequency:

Criteria: Determine how often routing tables should be updated, such as:
After receiving a ROUTE_REPLY.
Periodically based on a timer.
Upon detecting network changes via heartbeats.
Route Selection Criteria:

Metrics: Define the metrics used to determine the optimal route, such as:
Lowest latency.
Highest bandwidth.
Fewest hops.
Reliability scores based on connection health.
7.4. Secure Tunnel Management
Tunnel Establishment:

Handshake Protocol: Define the handshake process for establishing secure tunnels, including mutual authentication and key exchange mechanisms.
Configuration: Secure tunnel configurations (e.g., encryption keys, protocols) should be supplied via external configurations (JSON files or objects).
Tunnel Maintenance:

Integrity Checks: Implement periodic integrity checks to ensure that tunnels remain secure and functional.
Re-establishment: Define procedures for re-establishing tunnels in case of disruptions or detected security breaches.
7.5. Node Discovery Mechanism
Discovery Protocol:

Method: Specify the protocol or method used for discovering nearby nodes, such as:
Broadcasting discovery messages.
Peer discovery protocols leveraging existing Wi-Fi Direct APIs.
Discovery Frequency:

Interval: Decide how frequently node discovery occurs to balance network freshness with resource usage (e.g., battery life, bandwidth).
7.6. Performance Metrics and Monitoring
Critical Metrics:

Definition: Clearly define which performance metrics are critical for assessing network health, such as:
Latency.
Packet loss rate.
Throughput.
Connection stability.
Metric Utilization:

Decision-Making: Explain how collected metrics influence routing decisions, heartbeat frequency adjustments, and other network behaviors.
7.7. Failure Handling and Recovery
Types of Failures:

Identification: Identify specific failure types to handle, such as:
Node disconnection.
Message loss.
Data corruption.
Secure tunnel breaches.
Recovery Procedures:

Actions: Define recovery actions for each failure type, such as:
Rerouting messages through alternative paths.
Re-establishing lost connections.
Triggering cluster head elections upon cluster head failure.
7.8. Configuration Management
Configurable Settings:

Parameters: List all configurable settings, such as:
Heartbeat intervals.
Maximum hop counts.
Route selection criteria.
Encryption keys and protocols.
Dynamic Configuration:

Runtime Changes: Determine if configurations can be altered at runtime and how nodes will handle such changes without disrupting operations.
7.9. Testing and Simulation
Testing Scenarios:

Comprehensive Testing: Define specific scenarios to test network reliability and performance, such as:
High node churn (frequent joins and leaves).
Message flooding.
Secure tunnel establishment and closure.
Network partitioning and reconnection.
Testing Tools:

Frameworks: Decide on testing frameworks and simulation tools, such as:
JUnit/TestNG: For unit and integration testing.
Network Simulators: Custom-built simulators or existing tools to emulate multi-node environments and network conditions.
8. Example Method Stubs with Questions
Where specific details are missing, method stubs can include comments or placeholders indicating what needs to be defined.

Example: Cluster Head Election in Cluster Class

public class Cluster {
    // ...

    public void electClusterHead() {
        // Obtain adjacency matrix from PeerDirectory
        AdjacencyMatrix adjMatrix = node.peerDirectory.getAdjacencyMatrix();
        // Calculate centrality for each member
        Node newHead = CentralityCalculator.findHighestCentralityNode(members, adjMatrix);
        if (newHead != null && newHead.isAllowedClusterHead) {
            clusterHead = (ClusterHeadNode) newHead;
            clusterHead.broadcastClusterHeadAnnouncement();
            Logger.logInfo("New cluster head elected: " + newHead.getNodeId());

You said:
So, that was a great answer, and uh, the answer, uh, I had questions on chapter 7 with the missing perspectives and further considerations and let's go through them 1 / 1. So the eigenvector centrality calculation part, I would highly suggest to have an uh interface and one implementation. Of that interface would be through j grafty, for the election triggers. I don't think our system supports elections or needs elections. Each note. When it crosses a certain threshold, or it sees itself the most x central nodes automatically, it will register itself as a cluster head and it will form inform everyone else around it about. Uh, that decision, and also that decision would come as a setting from outside, allowing such a note to the acting as a cluster head or not. So this means that there will be a no journey All the way starting from coming with a lot of heartbeats getting to understand the structure of the network around it the rate of the heartbeat starts to decay by time till it is stable enough in terms of that, it can go to phase 3, which is being a cluster head after checking the the properties file. If it can be or not For the configurations, regardless how the implementary is going to do with it
When it comes to being a cluster head, a cluster head shall be following the event.
To maintain a struck, a routing table for the available paths to all the nodes within that cluster. So this means that even though The second point election triggers these events will not be. These events will not be triggering elections, but they will be. They will be asked and formed in a way or another informing. The and updating how routing happens to add to to to access one node remotely through multi hopes. So it will have a form of a routing table and that routing table says that if I want to go from me to route AI will I have the option of going through X or through Y and Z first for example, so whenever it needs to act as a cluster head and needs to perform its roles to give that security handshake. That is discussed above, it knows how to talk to cluster to note the h. N. Also, please don't forget to make sure that the heart beats are als. The heartbeats are answered from the gloucesterheads, informing the notes that they are the cluster heads, and the nodes also keep The information of that cluster head and the routing baths towards that cluster happened next point proceed outlined the steps call conducting elections. We said that the elections are relevant next point.
7.2 message surrealization and decent realization. So again, we don't need to make the choice. It will be also Jason, for testing and serializable objects in production, so it's going to be more or less. An interface with more than one implementation that we can switch between them in development mode and in production mode. 7.3, the routing table management. I think this is a really important point. So first of all, updating credit, we have 2 points, updating free frequency and the road selection criteria.
A biting frequency criteria determine how often routing tables should be updated. After receiving a route reply video, the business in a timer upon detection of lord metro changes via heartbeatsautomatically, it will register itself as a cluster head and it will form inform everyone else around it about.

So let's break it down together a bit-by-bit, so first of all, the heart beats within the network. I think we covered that in details earlier, but let's recap it. So when a user comes Tula, network, it's a form of a backup back of algorithm that there is
More or less, as if it's a negative Exponential curve, it starts that it goes with heartbeat, 1 second and then it goes for 4 seconds and then goes for 18 seconds and then and these numbers are not strict. They are just examples of how things go are slowing down that Delta tea is growing, and these Delta teas. Define the 3 different phases. The node will go through within the network, the first phase. When it's throwing a lot of hot beats, these hard beads are replied from nearby nodes, informing it about the network, about their connectivity towards that north about the paths towards the cluster head and so forthautomatically, it will register itself as a cluster head and it will form inform everyone else around it about.

When it's throwing a lot of hot beats, these hard beads are replied from nearby nodes, informing it about the network, about their connectivity towards that north about the paths towards the cluster head and so forth. The heartbeats, in the early stages of of the first 30% of that exponential curve, for example, a negative exponential group to make sure we're talking about the same thing here, the first 30%, or that the first the time before the user promotes itself from a fresh A. Newbie A note into a regular note that newbinote. We'll send heartbeats more often, but these hard beats will be replied from the network from the close proximity in terms of in the beginning. It will go for just informing the people next to it. And then and of course, the group owner, because it's it's, it's based on On the direct Wi-Fi director technology, the group owner and the other nodes will not further propagate. That that message to other uh, networks or other people. So the the path length would be won when the heartbeat slows down. The the puff length starts to increase to get free. Further depth within the network, the the the are 2 rows, mainly in acting within the network. The regular note that starts listening and broadcasting. According to the network needs, so for example, if it, if it finds a slow message, a message that had that very large Delta tea. And on our on a on a packet, and it opens its root, and it finds that the path is 6 and it can go up to 10, so it starts broadcasting that message to everyone around it as a regular user. Also, when it listens to such broadcasts, it sees it checks if that message with that message ID, we have been We have seen before or not if we did see before. I will not further propagate the message. Because this will make a loop within the within the within the root, which is not desirable. This shall give you a bit off vision of how a node shall react to keep the network healthy, so I expect also. In your answer, the small, uh, uh, summarization, the types of the messages the node will receive and how it will react in every scenario, and how would this affect the health of the network? And when we agree on that overall perspective of the note, I think that will make our Architecture quite salt. However, let's go through the rest of the points. The root selection criteria sued the root selection criteria. It can be balanced between these 4 keepis and at other gprs that the implementers will include, so I would highly suggest that this part would be architecturally designed to be A bit dynamic that we can incorporate extra ppis and define a balance between them. These skepy eyes, as if we are forming a weighted average of these kpis, according to uh, uh, a equal weights in the default behavior or a user preset weights to balance their needs, and that will take us to the next point, the the security tunnels management, so we will leave most of that to the implementary. However, there's a small differentiation that I would like to stress on. There are 2 security aspects in in this package. The first one is tunnels, behave and perform using the directory of the security keys sshkeys. Within I wouldn't our memory to build tunnels either through internet for handshakes, or whatever, if that's possible or through the ad hoc network to form longer routes, multi hub, so in either ways it will be an enter and encryption these tunnels and are built using The ssh keys stored within our systems and the sshkeys handshake, also with the example, explained with cluster a and cluster b. In earlier meeting, we have to store the acquired keys into our directories to be reused later, and this will also
Affect the eigenvalue, centrality. And the decision for Al add regular user to promote itself as a group owner and serve the rest of the people. I think this meeting chel. Answer your questions. Please update accordingly with uh, the same manner as before. However, answering our war questions and applying these comments

4.3. Heartbeat Phases
The heartbeat mechanism is designed to help nodes understand the network structure and achieve stability through a three-phase approach with negative exponential decay intervals.

Phase 1: Rapid Heartbeats (Discovery Phase)
Heartbeat Intervals: High-frequency (e.g., 1 second, 4 seconds).
Purpose:
Quickly gather information about nearby nodes.
Build the initial adjacency matrix for centrality calculation.
Node Actions:
Send heartbeats at rapid intervals.
Update PeerDirectory with responses.
Assess if the node qualifies as a cluster head based on centrality and configuration.
Phase 2: Moderate Heartbeats (Evaluation Phase)
Heartbeat Intervals: Medium-frequency (e.g., 18 seconds).
Purpose:
Continue monitoring network stability.
Refine centrality calculations based on updated adjacency matrix.
Node Actions:
Send heartbeats at decreasing intervals.
Re-evaluate centrality scores.
Transition to Phase 3 if network stability is achieved.
Phase 3: Low Heartbeats (Stability Phase)
Heartbeat Intervals: Low-frequency (e.g., 60 seconds).
Purpose:
Maintain network monitoring with minimal overhead.
Ensure long-term network stability.
Node Actions:
Send heartbeats at infrequent intervals.
Maintain updated PeerDirectory with minimal resource usage.
Transitioning Between Phases:

Nodes automatically transition through phases based on predefined intervals.
Stability assessments determine when to complete the transition.
External configuration flags can override phase behaviors to allow/disallow cluster head roles.
4.4. Routing Table Management
Responsibilities:

Maintains an up-to-date routing table reflecting available paths to all nodes within the cluster.
Dynamically updates the routing table based on received ROUTE_REPLY messages, periodic evaluations, and heartbeat signals.
Key Functionalities:

4.4.1. Updating Frequency
After Receiving a ROUTE_REPLY:
Immediately update the routing table with the new route information.
Periodic Timer:
Set a timer (e.g., every 5 minutes) to perform routine checks and updates to routing tables.
Detection of Network Changes via Heartbeats:
Adjust routes based on changes detected through heartbeat signals, such as node failures or new node arrivals.
4.4.2. Route Selection Criteria
Dynamic and Configurable:

Implement a weighted scoring system based on multiple KPIs (e.g., latency, packet loss, hop count).
Allow configurability through external settings to adjust weights based on user preferences.
Balanced Approach:

Use a balanced weighted average of KPIs to compute route scores.
Facilitate the addition of new KPIs without major architectural changes.
Implementation Example:

private double calculateRouteScore(Route route) {
    double totalLatency = 0.0;
    double totalPacketLoss = 0.0;
    int hopCount = route.getHops().size();

    for (String hopNodeId : route.getHops()) {
        PeerInfo peer = node.peerDirectory.getPeer(hopNodeId);
        if (peer != null) {
            Connection connection = node.connectionManager.findConnection(peer);
            if (connection != null) {
                ConnectionMetrics metrics = connection.getMetrics();
                totalLatency += metrics.getLatency();
                totalPacketLoss += metrics.getPacketLossRate();
            }
        }
    }

    // Fetch weights from configuration
    double latencyWeight = node.config.getLatencyWeight();
    double packetLossWeight = node.config.getPacketLossWeight();
    double hopCountWeight = node.config.getHopCountWeight();

    // Calculate weighted score
    double score = (totalLatency * latencyWeight) +
                   (totalPacketLoss * packetLossWeight) +
                   (hopCount * hopCountWeight);
    return score;
}
4.5. Secure Tunnel Management
4.5.1. Dual Security Aspects
Secure Tunnels via Internet:

Purpose: Enable secure communication channels between cluster heads over the internet.
Implementation:

Tunnels facilitate secure inter-cluster communications regardless of physical proximity.
Secure Tunnels via Ad-Hoc Network (Multi-Hop):

Purpose: Establish secure communication channels within the ad-hoc network through multi-hop paths.
Implementation:
Use SSH keys from KeyManager for mutual authentication and encryption.
Tunnels are established over existing ad-hoc connections, leveraging multi-hop routing for extended reach.
Secure tunnel information is maintained in directories for reuse and efficiency.
4.5.2. Secure Tunnel Establishment and Management
Steps:

Configuration Input:
Secure tunnel configurations (e.g., SSH keys, target cluster heads) are supplied externally via JSON files or objects.
Handshake Protocol:
Initiation: The initiating cluster head sends a SECURE_TUNNEL_ESTABLISH message to the target cluster head.
Authentication: Mutual authentication using SSH keys ensures both parties are legitimate.
Encryption Setup: Establish an encrypted channel using agreed-upon encryption protocols (e.g., AES-256).
Tunnel Maintenance:
Integrity Checks: Periodic verification of tunnel integrity to detect and prevent breaches.
Re-establishment: Automatic re-establishment of tunnels upon detection of disruptions.
Tunnel Closure:
Initiation: Either cluster head can send a SECURE_TUNNEL_CLOSE message to terminate the tunnel.
Resource Cleanup: Proper closure of encrypted channels and resource deallocation.
Implementation Example:

public class SecureTunnelManager {
    private EncryptionManager encryptionManager;
    private KeyManager keyManager;

    public SecureTunnelManager(EncryptionManager encryptionManager, KeyManager keyManager) {
        this.encryptionManager = encryptionManager;
        this.keyManager = keyManager;
    }

    public void establishTunnel(ClusterHeadNode local, ClusterHeadNode remote) {
        // Load SSH keys from KeyManager
        SecretKey key = keyManager.getPreSharedKey(remote.getNodeId());
        if (key == null) {
            Logger.logError("No pre-shared key found for " + remote.getNodeId());
            return;
        }

        // Establish secure tunnel
        SecureTunnel tunnel = new SecureTunnel(local, remote, encryptionManager);
        tunnel.establish();
        local.getSecureTunnels().add(tunnel);
    }

    public void closeTunnel(ClusterHeadNode local, ClusterHeadNode remote) {
        SecureTunnel tunnel = findTunnel(local, remote);
        if (tunnel != null && tunnel.isEstablished()) {
            tunnel.close();
            local.getSecureTunnels().remove(tunnel);
        }
    }

    private SecureTunnel findTunnel(ClusterHeadNode local, ClusterHeadNode remote) {
        for (SecureTunnel tunnel : local.getSecureTunnels()) {
            if (tunnel.getRemoteClusterHead().equals(remote)) {
                return tunnel;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
}

6. Comprehensive Node Behavior and Network Health
6.1. Cluster Head Selection and Registration
Network Discovery:

Upon joining the network, a node enters Phase 1 of the heartbeat mechanism, sending frequent heartbeats to discover and map nearby nodes.
Centrality Calculation:

As heartbeats are exchanged, nodes build their PeerDirectory and construct an adjacency matrix.
Using the CentralityCalculatorInterface, nodes calculate their eigenvector centrality scores.
Automatic Cluster Head Promotion:

If a node's centrality score exceeds the threshold defined in the configuration and it is allowed to be a cluster head (isAllowedClusterHead flag), it automatically promotes itself to a ClusterHeadNode.
Upon promotion, the node broadcasts a CLUSTER_HEAD_ANNOUNCEMENT to inform other nodes of its new role.
Cluster Formation:

Other nodes recognize the cluster head announcement and update their cluster memberships accordingly.
The cluster head initializes its intra-cluster routing table and establishes secure tunnels as necessary.
6.2. Heartbeat Mechanism Phases
Phase 1: Discovery Phase

Heartbeat Interval: 1 second, then 4 seconds, then 18 seconds.
Actions:
Send frequent heartbeats to discover nearby nodes.
Collect routing history and heartbeat responses to build the adjacency matrix.
Evaluate centrality scores to determine cluster head eligibility.
Phase 2: Evaluation Phase

Heartbeat Interval: Increases based on the negative exponential decay (e.g., 18 seconds to 60 seconds).
Actions:
Continue monitoring network stability.
Re-calculate centrality scores periodically.
Transition to Phase 3 upon achieving network stability.
Phase 3: Stability Phase

Heartbeat Interval: 60 seconds (configurable).
Actions:
Maintain minimal heartbeat signals to monitor long-term network health.
Ensure ongoing communication integrity and adjust routing as needed.
6.3. Message Handling and Network Health
Summary of Message Types and Node Reactions:

Message Type	Description	Node Reaction	Effect on Network Health
HEARTBEAT	Monitor node status and network connectivity	- Update PeerDirectory with sender's status.
- Adjust heartbeat frequency if necessary.	Ensures up-to-date knowledge of network peers, enabling accurate centrality calculations and routing decisions.
BROADCAST	General messages to all nodes	- Process or forward the message within the cluster.
- Prevent duplication to maintain efficiency.	Facilitates widespread information dissemination without overloading the network.
UNICAST	Direct messages between specific nodes	- If the message is for the node, process the payload.
- Otherwise, forward the message using RoutingManager.	Enables targeted communication, ensuring messages reach intended recipients efficiently.
ROUTE_REQUEST	Initiate route discovery to a destination node	- If capable, provide route information.
- Otherwise, forward the request to discover routes.	Enhances dynamic route discovery, improving network flexibility and connectivity.
ROUTE_REPLY	Respond to route requests with available routes	- Update RoutingTable with the new route information.
- Potentially acknowledge the route discovery.	Improves routing efficiency by incorporating discovered paths, reducing message latency and hop counts.
ACKNOWLEDGMENT	Confirm receipt of a message	- Confirm successful receipt of messages.
- Optionally trigger further actions based on acknowledgment.	Ensures reliable message delivery and prevents unnecessary retransmissions, maintaining network integrity.
CLUSTER_HEAD_ANNOUNCEMENT	Announce a node's role as a cluster head	- Update PeerDirectory with the new cluster head.
- Establish secure tunnels if necessary.
- Adjust routing tables to include new routes.	Maintains accurate cluster head information, enabling efficient intra-cluster and inter-cluster routing and secure communications.
SECURE_TUNNEL_ESTABLISH	Request to establish a secure tunnel between nodes	- Engage EncryptionManager to establish the tunnel.
- Respond with acknowledgment or error based on tunnel establishment success.	Ensures secure communication channels between cluster heads, enhancing data security and trust within the network.
SECURE_TUNNEL_CLOSE	Request to close an existing secure tunnel	- Engage EncryptionManager to close the tunnel.
- Confirm tunnel closure to the requesting node.	Terminates unnecessary or compromised secure channels, conserving resources and maintaining communication security.
DATA	Carry actual data payloads between nodes	- Decrypt and process the data payload.
- Deliver the data to the application layer or forward it as needed.	Facilitates the exchange of information, enabling application-specific functionalities while maintaining data security through encryption.
Impact on Network Health:

Reliability: Acknowledgments and route updates ensure that messages are delivered reliably, preventing data loss.
Security: Secure tunnel management protects sensitive data, fostering trust among nodes.
Efficiency: Dynamic routing and intelligent heartbeat management optimize network performance, reducing latency and conserving resources.
Scalability: Automated cluster head promotion and secure tunnel establishment support network growth without manual interventions.

        EigenvectorCentrality<String, DefaultEdge> centrality = new EigenvectorCentrality<>(graph);
        centrality.initialize();

        double maxCentrality = Double.MIN_VALUE;
        String highestNode = null;

        for (int i = 0; i < nodeIds.size(); i++) {
            String nodeId = nodeIds.get(i);
            if (eligibilityFlags.get(i)) {
                double score = centrality.getVertexScore(nodeId);
                if (score > maxCentrality) {

        Map<String, Integer> nodeIndexMap = adjMatrix.getNodeIndexMap();
        Map<Integer, String> indexNodeMap = adjMatrix.getIndexNodeMap();

        // Add vertices
        for (String nodeId : nodeIndexMap.keySet()) {
            graph.addVertex(nodeId);
        }

        // Add edges
        int[][] matrix = adjMatrix.getMatrix();
        for (int i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++) {

                }
            }
        }

        return graph;
    }
}
7.1.2. Automatic Cluster Head Promotion
Implementation in Node Class:

public void evaluateAndDecideClusterHead() {
    // Only proceed if allowed to be a cluster head
    if (!isAllowedClusterHead) {
        return;
    }

    // Calculate centrality score using the centrality calculator
    AdjacencyMatrix adjMatrix = peerDirectory.getAdjacencyMatrix();
    centralityScore = centralityCalculator.calculateEigenvectorCentrality(adjMatrix, nodeId);
    Logger.logInfo("Node " + nodeId + " calculated centrality score: " + centralityScore);

    // Check if centrality exceeds threshold from configuration
    double threshold = config.getCentralityThreshold();
    if (centralityScore >= threshold && currentCluster == null) {
        // Promote to cluster head
        promoteToClusterHead();
    }
}
Promotion Method:

private void promoteToClusterHead() {
    // Transition to ClusterHeadNode behavior
    // This could involve casting or creating a new ClusterHeadNode instance
    // For simplicity, assuming Node can handle ClusterHead responsibilities
    Logger.logInfo("Node " + nodeId + " promoting itself to Cluster Head.");
    // Broadcast cluster head announcement
    Message announcement = new Message(this.nodeId, "ALL", "I am now a Cluster Head".getBytes(), MessageType.CLUSTER_HEAD_ANNOUNCEMENT);
    sendMessage(announcement);
}
7.2. Message Serialization and Deserialization
7.2.1. Interface and Implementations
Serialization Interface:

public interface MessageSerializer {
    byte[] serialize(Message message);
    Message deserialize(byte[] data);

        json.put("routingHistory", message.getRoutingHistory());
        json.put("timestamp", message.getTimestamp());
        return json.toString().getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
    }

    @Override
    public Message deserialize(byte[] data) {
        String jsonString = new String(data, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
        JSONObject json = new JSONObject(jsonString);
        String source = json.getString("sourceNodeId");

        message.timestamp = timestamp;
        return message;
    }
}
Protocol Buffers-Based Implementation:

// Assuming you've defined a protobuf schema for Message
// and generated the corresponding Java classes.

package com.vrouting.network.adhoc;

public class ProtoBufMessageSerializer implements MessageSerializer {

Integration in Message Class:

public class Message {
    // Existing fields and methods

    // Serialization using the chosen serializer
    private static MessageSerializer serializer = new JSONMessageSerializer(); // Switch to ProtoBufMessageSerializer() in production

    public byte[] toBytes() {

    public static Message fromBytes(byte[] data) {
        return serializer.deserialize(data);
    }
}
7.3. Routing Table Management
Responsibilities:

Maintains an up-to-date routing table reflecting available paths to all nodes within the cluster.
Dynamically updates the routing table based on received ROUTE_REPLY messages, periodic evaluations, and heartbeat signals.
Implements dynamic route selection based on multiple KPIs with configurable weights.
Key Functionalities:

7.3.1. Updating Frequency
After Receiving a ROUTE_REPLY:
Immediately update the routing table with the new route information.
Periodic Timer:
Set a timer (e.g., every 5 minutes) to perform routine checks and updates to routing tables.
Detection of Network Changes via Heartbeats:
Adjust routes based on changes detected through heartbeat signals, such as node failures or new node arrivals.
7.3.2. Route Selection Criteria
Dynamic and Configurable:

Implement a weighted scoring system based on multiple KPIs (e.g., latency, packet loss, hop count).
Allow configurability through external settings to adjust weights based on user preferences.
Balanced Approach:

Use a balanced weighted average of KPIs to compute route scores.
Facilitate the addition of new KPIs without major architectural changes.
Implementation Example in RoutingManager:

private double calculateRouteScore(Route route) {
    double totalLatency = 0.0;
    double totalPacketLoss = 0.0;
    int hopCount = route.getHops().size();

    for (String hopNodeId : route.getHops()) {
        PeerInfo peer = node.peerDirectory.getPeer(hopNodeId);
        if (peer != null) {
            Connection connection = node.connectionManager.findConnection(peer);
            if (connection != null) {
                ConnectionMetrics metrics = connection.getMetrics();
                totalLatency += metrics.getLatency();
                totalPacketLoss += metrics.getPacketLossRate();
            }
        }
    }

    // Fetch weights from configuration
    double latencyWeight = node.config.getLatencyWeight();
    double packetLossWeight = node.config.getPacketLossWeight();
    double hopCountWeight = node.config.getHopCountWeight();

    // Calculate weighted score
    double score = (totalLatency * latencyWeight) +
                   (totalPacketLoss * packetLossWeight) +
                   (hopCount * hopCountWeight);
    return score;
}
Dynamic Route Selection:

Weighted Average Calculation: Routes are scored based on the weighted average of selected KPIs.
Configuration-Based Weights: Users can adjust weights via external configuration files to prioritize different KPIs according to their needs.
Extensibility: New KPIs can be added with minimal changes, enhancing the flexibility of the routing logic.
