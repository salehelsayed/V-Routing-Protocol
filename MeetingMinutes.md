Before discussing the appropriate architecture for your Java project applying this protocol on top of sockets, I would need clarification on a few critical areas:

Protocol Integration Details:

How do you plan to integrate the Wi-Fi-based P2P ad-hoc protocol with your Java application? Are there specific libraries or Android APIs that you intend to use?
Will the project include a multi-hop messaging layer, and how will it handle message relays between cluster heads?
Cluster Management:

What strategy will you use for cluster formation and cluster head election? Will you implement "Eigen vector centrality" directly in Java, or do you have a different approach in mind?
What mechanism will you use to manage connections between multiple clusters (e.g., encrypted tunnels)?
Scalability Requirements:

What is the expected maximum number of devices per subnetwork?
How will your architecture handle dynamic changes in cluster membership?
Routing and Security:

How do you plan to implement routing logic between clusters? Will you use static routing, dynamic routing, or a hybrid approach?
What encryption methods will you use for tunnel management and secure communication?
Connectivity Scenarios:

How will your application differentiate between internet-connected and offline modes? What fallback mechanisms are planned for offline operations?
Testing and Maintenance:

What kind of testing environment do you envision for simulating multi-hop messaging and cluster communication?
How do you plan to monitor and maintain the system's performance and security?
Answering these questions will ensure the architectural discussion is well-aligned with your project's requirements and challenges.

1.1: that is what we want to develop. 
1.2: this is the main aim of the project
2.1: Java for now, but make it as an interface to be implemented in anyother way
2.2: pre-existing security keyes shared between users that exist in different clusters.
3.1: it's decentralized. question can't be answered
3.2: Group Owner will inform the Cluster Head
4.1: within the Cluster DSR
4.2: Use AES256 / or public-private certificates 
5.1: then using offline mode (adhoc netwokr) if available. then use secure tunnle if available, then use ADHOC augmented with Secure Tunnles as described in the document as a fallback mechanism. The order can be changed through properties file.
6.1: Testing different scenarios of :
- routing fallback algorithm as defined in the document
- switching in routing priorities
- simulating multiple instances of the nodes and collect them as a network and report network connectivity KPIs as if we are simulating an agent based model 
6.2: out of scope for now

comments on Layered Architecture Design. your output is very shallow and here are my comments:
1.1 Application layer: the expected output of this package is either secure connection, or connection that communicates next to the socket the details about the connection like number of physical available connections in case of adhoc, connection health, connection type, and connection security level. 
1.2 Netowkr Management Layer: This layer shall be splitted further and shall be detailed more
1.3 Use TLS 1.3
1.4: expand on the heartbeat details
---
Focus on the architecture and we'll come back for the rest of the details

Thank you for your detailed comments. Here's an updated and deeper dive into the Layered Architecture Design that incorporates your feedback and adds more precision:

Revised Layered Architecture Design
1. Application Layer
Responsibilities:
This layer provides the interface and orchestrates the network's functionalities for the upper-level user or system.
Expected outputs:
Secure Connection: Ensures TLS 1.3 connections for encrypted communication.
Connection Metadata: Provides details such as:
Number of physical connections (for ad-hoc).
Connection health (e.g., latency, jitter, and packet loss rate).
Connection type (ad-hoc, tunnel, or hybrid).
Connection security level (e.g., TLS vs. fallback to AES256 for offline mode).
Implementation Details:
Abstract Connection Manager Interface:
Exposes API for requesting, managing, and closing connections.
Automatically determines the most secure available connection method.
Connection Health Monitor:
Runs in parallel and gathers metrics such as latency, availability of fallback routes, and current security status.
Communicates health data via a dedicated monitoring channel alongside the socket connection.
2. Network Management Layer
This layer is critical and needs to be split into two sublayers for better modularity and focus.

2.1 Cluster Management Sublayer
Responsibilities:
Handles cluster formation, maintenance, and role assignments (e.g., Group Owner and Cluster Head).
Manages the cluster head election using eigenvector centrality or similar methods.
Ensures scalability by adapting to changes in cluster size and membership.
Implementation Details:
Cluster Discovery:
Broadcasts periodic discovery signals to identify neighboring nodes.
Maintains a registry of known nodes with roles, status, and available connections.
Cluster Head Election:
Calculates eigenvector centrality for eligible nodes.
Implements redundancy for the cluster head role to ensure robustness.
Cluster Hierarchy Synchronization:
Shares updates on cluster membership and routing pathways with peer clusters.
2.2 Routing Sublayer
Responsibilities:
Manages the flow of messages within clusters (intra-cluster) and between clusters (inter-cluster).
Implements routing mechanisms, including:
Dynamic Source Routing (DSR): Within clusters.
Hybrid Routing Protocol: For inter-cluster communication (utilizing encrypted tunnels and fallback mechanisms).
Implementation Details:
Routing Table Management:
Maintains real-time updates of reachable nodes and optimal paths.
Prioritizes routes based on user preferences (configurable via properties file).
Fallback Mechanism:
Switches between ad-hoc, tunnel, and hybrid connections dynamically based on availability and performance metrics.
3. Security Layer
Responsibilities:
Provides encryption and secure communication mechanisms at all layers of the network stack.
Handles key exchange, certificate validation, and connection integrity.
Implementation Details:
TLS 1.3:
Primary protocol for secure connections where internet access is available.
Provides forward secrecy and reduced latency for secure handshakes.
Offline Mode Security:
AES-256 encryption with pre-shared keys for ad-hoc communication.
Public/private key pairs for inter-cluster secure tunnels.
Session Management:
Manages the lifecycle of security keys and certificates.
Periodically rotates keys to enhance security.
4. Communication Layer
Responsibilities:
Establishes and maintains the raw connections for message exchange and network operations.
Implements the heartbeat mechanism to monitor node status and ensure connectivity.
Expanded Heartbeat Implementation:
Broadcast Mechanism:
Sends periodic signals to neighboring nodes to confirm availability.
Signal frequency decays over time: starts every second, scales up to every minute.
Heartbeat Phases:
Phase 1: Initialization:
New node broadcasts “I’m here” to neighboring nodes.
Receives acknowledgment to confirm entry into the cluster.
Phase 2: Stabilization:
Stability indicators ensure the node is part of a functioning cluster.
Neighboring nodes propagate the node's status to second-degree nodes.
Phase 3: Expansion:
Supports up to 4 hops, after which the node either joins a cluster or acts as a standalone unit.
Failure Detection:
Absence of heartbeat signals triggers a node removal event.
Routing tables update to reflect the node's unavailability.
Integration with Monitoring:
Heartbeat data feeds into the Application Layer’s health monitoring system.
Enables proactive rerouting and resource optimization.
Overall Key Features
Separation of Concerns:
Clear modularity ensures that each layer handles a specific set of responsibilities.
Facilitates testing, debugging, and future enhancements.
Interface-Based Design:
Both the Network Management Layer and Security Layer rely on interfaces, making it easy to swap implementations for different environments (e.g., replacing Java Sockets with gRPC in the future).
Scalability:
Hierarchical cluster management and hybrid routing protocols ensure that the architecture scales well in dynamic environments.
Extensibility:
Routing priorities, fallback mechanisms, and connection policies are configurable via a properties file.
